# Bug Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-10-09

### 1. CSV Tax Records Upload Error - Fixed ✅

**Problem:** 
- Error: "Only CSV files are allowed!" when trying to upload CSV files
- Status code 400 (Bad Request)
- File type validation was too strict

**Root Cause:**
The multer file filter in `server/src/routes/adminRoutes.js` only accepted files with MIME type `text/csv`, but CSV files can have various MIME types depending on the browser and operating system.

**Solution:**
1. **Server-Side (adminRoutes.js):**
   - Expanded accepted MIME types to include:
     - `text/csv`
     - `application/csv`
     - `text/plain`
     - `application/vnd.ms-excel`
     - `application/octet-stream`
   - Added file extension validation as fallback
   - Enhanced error messages to show actual MIME type received
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

2. **Client-Side (AdminPage.tsx):**
   - Added client-side validation before upload:
     - Validates file extension (.csv only)
     - Validates file size (5MB limit)
   - Updated file input to only accept CSV files
   - Enhanced error handling with detailed console logging
   - Improved user feedback with specific error messages

**Files Modified:**
- `server/src/routes/adminRoutes.js` (lines 187-213)
- `client/src/components/AdminPage.tsx` (lines 575-649, 5165)

### 2. Villager Edit Request Error - Fixed ✅

**Problem:**
- Error 500 (Internal Server Error) when submitting villager edit requests
- Error occurred at line 358 in villagerController.js

**Root Cause:**
Variable scope issue in the `submitVillagerEditRequest` function. The `mobileNumber` variable was being reassigned inside a conditional block, causing it to be `undefined` when trying to update the database.

**Solution:**
1. Declared `normalizedMobileNumber` variable outside the conditional block
2. Used `normalizedMobileNumber` instead of `mobileNumber` when updating the database
3. This ensures the normalized mobile number is always available for the update operation

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before (problematic):
if (mobileNumber) {
  let normalizedMobileNumber = mobileNumber.trim();
  // ... normalization logic
  mobileNumber = normalizedMobileNumber; // This assignment was the issue
}
if (mobileNumber) updateData.mobileNumber = mobileNumber; // Could be undefined

// After (fixed):
let normalizedMobileNumber = mobileNumber;
if (mobileNumber) {
  normalizedMobileNumber = mobileNumber.trim();
  // ... normalization logic
}
if (normalizedMobileNumber) updateData.mobileNumber = normalizedMobileNumber; // Always defined
```

**Files Modified:**
- `server/src/controllers/villagerController.js` (lines 350-359, 378)

### 3. Contract Page Layout Improvements - Fixed ✅

**Problem:**
- Ongoing contract page's view detail section had poor layout and alignment in scrollable window
- Content was not properly aligned within the dialog
- Inconsistent spacing and responsiveness issues

**Solution:**
1. **Dialog Container:**
   - Changed from fixed viewport dimensions to responsive sizing
   - Implemented proper flex layout with scrollable content area
   - Added overflow management

2. **Content Layout:**
   - Improved grid layouts with better breakpoints
   - Consistent spacing with proper utility classes
   - Better responsive text sizing
   - Added flex-shrink-0 to prevent icon distortion

3. **ScrollableWindow:**
   - Perfect alignment within scrollable area
   - Consistent padding throughout
   - Clear visual hierarchy with separated header, content, and footer

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/ContractsPage.tsx` (lines 43, 50-53, 86-112, 616-878)
